NEXT ROUND — Extend/refine based on the latest synthesis:
- Add incremental insights only (no repetition).
- Tighten thresholds; turn soft language into testable criteria.
- Call out any conflicts with prior rounds (1–2 bullets).
- Provide exactly one small “field test” runnable in <10 minutes.

Return: short narrative + bullets/JSON + 1 field test.
