# CAMS Test Run — Round 2 (SOLO)

**Run ID:** run_20251020_01  
**Topic:** testing cams  
**Objectives:** testing the full cams protocall (solo loop validation)

## What we validated (Round 1 → Round 2)
- Memory indexes reachable (no fallback needed).
- Deterministic RUN_ID computed and confirmed.
- Monitoring expanded with schema + secret-scan checks.
- Lessons + Env-delta drafts prepared; run.json skeleton produced.

## Indicators (pass/fail gates)
- RUN_ID regex pass.
- `monitoring.json` has required keys: run_id, mode, checks, indicators, timestamp_utc.
- Secret-scan heuristic finds 0 matches for AWS-style keys, 32–64 hex blobs, generic Bearer tokens, or nearby “api key/token/secret” patterns.

## Next
- On TASK END: emit final A–D blocks and run the publish one-liner (or paste-fallback).
